Thailand has used several calendar systems during its history and some are still in use today. This library provides `datetime.date`-like classes for working with the Thai lunisolar calendar of the Chulasakarat Era (จุลศักราช) and the lunar Pakkhakhananaa calendar (ปฏิทินปักขคณนา).

## Installation

```bash
python3 -m pip install pythaidate
```
